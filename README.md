### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is AndrÃ© Fakhoury. I'm a Brazilian CS student at University of SÃ£o Paulo.

- ðŸ–¼ My favorite research areas are Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Vision and Image Processing
- ðŸ–¥ I enjoy to learn algorithms and data structures related to Competitive Programming (you can check out my [ICPC](https://icpc.global/ICPCID/ZHCQSDH16FWX) and [Codeforces](https://www.codeforces.com/profile/fakhoury) profiles)
- ðŸŽ¬ I also made some [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/gemaicmc) and [blog posts](http://gema.icmc.usp.br/Material) about some topics on Competitive Programming in Portuguese :)
